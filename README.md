# CALORIEMETER

Calorimeter will help you calculate how many calories you need and record what you consume throughout the day.

Thanks to the enormous food database, you can search for any food that youâ€™d like to add to your list. Furthermore, food can be created manually and catalogued at the desired time.

With Calorimeter, you can gain or lose weight as planned or maintain your diet. The macronutrients will be calculated precisely with the equations from the literature.

It uses FoodData Central API to fetch nutrition data
